      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      <li>Java is an object-oriented programming language with its runtime environment. It is a combination of features of C and C++ with some essential additional concepts.
      </li>
      <li>Java is well suited for both standalone and web application development and is designed to provide solutions to most of the problems faced by users of the internet era.
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>Java programs are platform independent which means they can be run on any operating system with any processor as long as the Java interpreter is available on that system.Java code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another platform; it's called write once, run anywhere(WORA).</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Java_If_Statement">
    <header>
      <h3>Java If Statement</h3>
    </header>
    <p>If statements in Java is used to control the program flow based on some condition, it's used to execute some statement code block if the expression evaluated to true; otherwise, it will get skipped. This statement is the simplest way to modify the control flow of the program.</p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        if(test_expression)
        {
        statement 1;
        statement 2;
        ...
        }
      </code>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Java_If_Else_Statement">
    <header>
      <h3>Java If Else Statement</h3>
    </header>
    <p>If else statements in Java is also used to control the program flow based on some condition, only the difference is: it's used to execute some statement code block if the expression is evaluated to true, otherwise executes else statement code block.</p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        if(test_expression)
        {
        //execute your code
        }
        else
        {
        //execute your code
        }
      </code>
    </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Java_While_Loop">
    <header>
      <h3>Java While Loop</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      <li>
        Java while loops statement allows to repeatedly run the same block of code until a condition is met.
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>
        While loop is the most basic loop in Java. It has one control condition and executes as long the condition is true. The condition of the loop is tested before the body of the loop is executed; hence it is called an entry-controlled loop.</li>
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        While (condition)
        {
        statement(s);
        Incrementation;
        }
      </code>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Java_For_Loop">
    <header>
      <h3>
        Java For Loop
      </h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      <li>
        Java for loops is very similar to Java while loops in that it continues to process a block of code until a statement becomes false, and everything is defined in a single line.
      </li>
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        for ( init; condition; increment )
        {
        statement(s);
        }
      </code>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Java_Do_While_Loop">
    <header>
      <h3>
        Java Do While Loop
      </h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Java do-while loops are very similar to the while loops, but it always executes the code block at least once and furthermore as long as the condition remains true. This loop is an exit-controlled loop.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        do
        {
        statement(s);

        }while( condition );
      </code>
